                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Chronic wounds are wounds that take longer than three months to heal and inflict a disproportionate burden 
                    on patients and the healthcare system. They are frequently subsequent complications of more persistent health issues. 
                    Biofilms contribute to the slower healing of around 80% of chronic wounds. Our project, QBlock, aims to limit biofilm 
                    formation by targeting bacterial communication molecules (i.e. AIPs) that contribute to biofilm formation in 
                    <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> by inhibiting bacterial communication with DARPins (designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), 
                    which are synthetic proteins that mimic antibodies. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Through the manipulation and randomization of amino acid locations, 
                    a DNA library of 42 DARPins was created. AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and their affinity for 
                    AIP was determined experimentally by ribosomal display. In control tests, a DARPin with a known sequence was used to 
                    bind GFP. Not only did structural predictions and simulations validate a strong binding with AIP, but they also 
                    emphasized the uniqueness and diversity of DARPins.

                <p>
                    Chronic wounds are a burden for both the patient and the healthcare system as a whole. They are frequently caused 
                    by other underlying chronic diseases and are therefore known as a "silent epidemic" (Benitez et al., 2019). The biggest 
                    difference between chronic wounds and other wounds is that they have a significantly reduced healing time, and can stay 
                    open for three months or even more.

                    <strong>Biofilms</strong>, which are structured communities of microorganisms, are present in around <strong>80%</strong> of chronic 
                    wounds (Malone et al., 2017) and impede their recovery (IWII, 2022). In the early stage bacteria attach to a surface - in this case, 
                    the open wound site - and reproduce, forming microcolonies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They then communicate with other bacteria via a process called <strong>quorum sensing</strong>, where small <strong>auto-inducer peptides (AIPs)</strong> (in the case of <em>S. Epidermidis</em>) are released 
                    to attract more and more bacteria to the same site (Madigan et al., 2009; Olson et al., 2014). This allows them to know their population density, which is very important for 
                    the onset of infection for bacteria.

                <p>
                    The maturing biofilm now forms a polysaccharide matrix, in which the colonising bacteria can become dormant. 
                    This is bad news: dormant bacteria have decreased metabolic activity, which makes them <strong>tolerant towards antibiotics</strong> 
                    because antibiotics are usually taken up by the active bacterium and affect its metabolic pathways.

                <p>
                    In affluent nations, chronic wounds affect an estimated <strong>1% to 2%</strong> of the population (Järbrink et al., 2016), while <strong>up to 50 % of acute hospital beds in 
                    Europe</strong> are taken up by patients that suffer from either acute or chronic wounds - though the greater proportion is occupied 
                    by the latter (Moore et al., 2014). Increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and an ageing population are the main contributors to their growing 
                    prevalence and burden. It is clear that this is a huge economical problem, not to mention the distress experienced by the patients.

                    The Aalto-Helsinki iGEM 2022 team plans to block the process of quorum sensing via <strong>DARPins</strong> (designed ankyrin repeat proteins), 
                    which are peptides that resemble antibodies but that possess more favourable properties. Thanks to their small size, 
                    DARPins should be able to penetrate the biofilm’s matrix and bind to the molecules that are used in quorum sensing of <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> (i.e. AIPs).

                <p>
                    Once DARPins successfully bind to AIPs, these small peptides can no longer be used for signalling to other bacteria, 
                    which means that <strong>they will stop accumulating into biofilm on the wound site.</strong> The end result, we predict, is that reduced biofilm 
                    coverage of the wound makes it more responsive to treatment, as a key cause of immune system and antimicrobial tolerance has been 
                    removed.

                <p>
                    We aim to design and optimise an efficient DNA library of different DARPin molecules by modifying and 
                    randomising specific amino acid positions so that biofilm formation in <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis)</em> 
                    is arrested. The designed library is used in ribosome display to select the DARPin with the highest affinity towards 
                    the target AIP1 peptide, which in turn will inhibit the quorum sensing mechanism of S. epidermidis.

                    Our construct was based on three key settings: (1) previous and current state-of-the-art scientific research on designed 
                    DARPin molecules, (2) most successful DARPins that bound to their intended targets, and (3) most successful randomised 
                    IR modules that resulted in successful outcomes. With this strategy, we expected DARPins with excellent biophysical 
                    properties as well as high affinity and stability.

                <p>
                    It is aimed to affinity select DARPins binding AIP with the help of ribosome display. For this the DNA of the DARPin, 
                    which needs to be expressed, is needed. 32 of the potentially AIP targeting DARPins were synthesised via the BioXPTM 
                    by Codex DNA. In order to ensure that no random dimers or fragments are present in the synthesised DARPins they needed 
                    to be purified via gel extraction.

                <p>
                    As we wanted to prove that the selection method could be successful for our AIP binding DARPins, we firstly wanted 
                    to prove the method with a known protein-protein binding. We chose GFP binding DARPins as our test targeting protein, 
                    and naturally GFP as the target protein. For this, we aimed to produce our own GFP protein by expressing superfold-GFP 
                    in E. coli expression cells.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the experiments, we aimed to test both our own AIP binding DARPins, as well as our known GFP binding DARPin. 
                    To prove the quality of the binding affinity, we also placed our AIP binding DARPin in the same reaction with the 
                    GFP binding DARPin. This will prove that the most suitable DARPin will always bind to the specific target.

                <p>
                    The idea of coupling next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis to the ribosome display method is to confirm the 
                    success of our control molecule (i.e., the GFP DARPin) (Hansen et al., 2017) and to effectively identify our DARPin 
                    binding molecules against the AIP peptide. In addition, we aim to analyse such DARPin molecules at the RNA level for 
                    the identification of the most prominent amino acids at the randomised positions as well as potential patterns that 
                    can lead to the binding effect.

                    Our product QBlock would serve as a treatment for chronic wounds, particularly in their initial phases. 
                    Commonly, they manifest as a subsequent complication of longer-lasting health issues. Most chronic wounds have 
                    biofilms, which are mediated by quorum sensing. Our goal with the QBLOCK project is to reduce biofilm development 
                    by preventing bacterial autoinducing peptides (AIPs) from inducing other bacteria or the bacteria themselves through 
                    the use of DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins). We were needed to answer a few crucial questions in order to 
                    demonstrate our capacity to accomplish these actions necessary for the final product and its intended effect.

                <p>
                    1. Is the DARPin production and the process of their affinity selection feasible?

                <br>
                <p>
                    2. Can our bioreporter gauge the extent of quorum sensing and can the pathway be inhibited?

                    Measuring quorum sensing levels with a bioreporter
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To prove the impact that the DARPins have on the signalling molecules, we wanted a bioreporter that was able to 
                    produce the needed membrane proteins and internal signalling proteins, to bind the signalling molecules (AIP's) 
                    and then give an output to show that the cell has received the information of the binding. 
                    For this part of the project we took inspiration from a last year's iGEM team (Team IISER, Kolkata, 2021 iGEM team), 
                    who had built a bioreporter with the parts aimed to sense signalling molecules released from <em>S. Aureus</em> bacteria. 
                    They had successful results, which made us confident that we can build a similar bioreporter but aimed for 
                    <em>S. epidermidis.</em>

                    Through the manipulation and randomization of amino acid locations, a DNA library of 42 DARPins was created. 
                    AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and their affinity for AIP was determined experimentally by 
                    ribosomal display. With our project, we showed that ribosome display can be an effective method for selecting the 
                    most suitable DARPin for the target signalling molecule, by testing the system with a known GFP-binding DARPin. 
                    We also built a bioreporter for detecting the effect our DARPins have on blocking the signalling between the bacteria. 
                    We tested the baseline signal of GFP from the bioreporter, however, due to time restrictions, we did not have time to 
                    test the bioreporter with DARPins included.

                <p>
                    In order to implement QBlock in the real world, we still have to take some steps. We have now identified potential 
                    candidate DARPins as the basis for QBlock. The first steps that we would need to take is to confirm that this is indeed 
                    the best performing DARPin out of our original 10^12 library. This can be done by increasing the size of the library, 
                    repeating the experiment and checking whether a DARPin with a higher affinity towards the target AIP exists.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We were able to show that our bioreporter is inducible with AIP and maybe could test it against the DARPIn. However, 
                    the inducible promoter used for GFP seemed to be leaky, therefore, improvement of the expression system is still needed. 
                    We can also show the effectiveness of the DARPin in other ways than testing it with a bioreporter. In order to check that 
                    the DARPin is inhibiting biofilm formation, we should continue with our planned in vitro model and check QBlock's effect 
                    on <em>S. epidermidis</em>. This was not feasible in this project due to time constraints, but should be performed in future to 
                    measure biofilm formation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To be able to eventually utilise QBlock in a wound care setting, we have to finalise a suitable delivery mechanism first.
                    A possible admininstration method we looked into was a hydrogel dressing. The admininstration method and the safety of our DARPin 
                    product would need to be tested preclinically and clinically.
