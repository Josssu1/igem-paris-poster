                <br>
                <p>Chronic wounds are wounds that take longer than three months to heal and inflict a disproportionate burden 
                    on patients and the healthcare system. They are frequently subsequent complications of more persistent health issues. 
                    Biofilms contribute to the slower healing of around 80% of chronic wounds. Our project, QBlock, aims to limit biofilm 
                    formation by targeting bacterial communication molecules (i.e. AIPs) that contribute to biofilm formation in 
                    <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> by inhibiting bacterial communication with DARPins (designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), 
                    which are synthetic proteins that mimic antibodies. Through the manipulation and randomization of amino acid locations, 
                    a DNA library of 42 DARPins was created. AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and their affinity for 
                    AIP was determined experimentally by ribosomal display. In control tests, a DARPin with a known sequence was used to 
                    bind GFP. Not only did structural predictions and simulations validate a strong binding with AIP, but they also 
                    emphasized the uniqueness and diversity of DARPins.

            <div class="text_container">
                <p>
                    <strong>Chronic wounds</strong> are wounds that take longer than three months to heal and inflict a disproportionate burden on patients 
                    and the healthcare system. They are frequently subsequent complications of more persistent health issues.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Biofilms</strong>, which are structured communities of microorganisms, are present in around <strong>80%</strong> of chronic wounds and impede 
                    their recovery. In the early stage bacteria attach to a surface - in this case, the open wound site - and reproduce, 
                    forming microcolonies.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    They then communicate with other bacteria via a process called <strong>quorum sensing</strong>, where small <strong>auto-inducer peptides (AIPs)</strong> are released 
                    to attract more and more bacteria to the same site. This allows them to know their population density, which is very important for 
                    the onset of infection for bacteria.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The maturing biofilm now forms a polysaccharide matrix, in which the colonising bacteria can become dormant. 
                    This is bad news: dormant bacteria have decreased metabolic activity, which makes them <strong>tolerant towards antibiotics</strong> 
                    because antibiotics are usually taken up by the active bacterium and affect its metabolic pathways.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>1 - 2 % of the global population</strong> experience chronic wounds during their lifetime, while <strong>up to 50 % of hospital beds in 
                    Europe</strong> are taken up by patients that suffer from either acute or chronic wounds - though the greater proportion is occupied 
                    by the latter. Increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and an ageing population are the main contributors to their growing 
                    prevalence and burden. It is clear that this is a huge economical problem, not to mention the distress experienced by the patients.

                    The Aalto-Helsinki iGEM 2022 team plans to block the process of quorum sensing via <strong>DARPins</strong> (designed ankyrin repeat proteins), 
                    which are proteins that mimic antibodies but that possess more favourable properties. Thanks to their small size, 
                    DARPins should be able to penetrate the biofilm’s matrix and bind to the molecules that are used in quorum sensing of <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> (i.e. AIPs).
                </p> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once DARPins successfully bind to AIPs, these small peptides can no longer be used for signalling to other bacteria, 
                    which means that <strong>they will stop accumulating into biofilm on the wound site.</strong> The end result, we predict, is that reduced biofilm 
                    coverage of the wound makes it more responsive to treatment, as a key cause of immune system and antimicrobial tolerance has been 
                    removed.

                <h3>
                    1. DARPin library
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We aim to design and optimise an efficient DNA library of different DARPin molecules by modifying and 
                    randomising specific amino acid positions so that biofilm formation in <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis)</em> 
                    is arrested. The designed library is used in ribosome display to select the DARPin with the highest affinity towards 
                    the target AIP1 peptide, which in turn will inhibit the quorum sensing mechanism of S. epidermidis.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our construct was based on three key settings: (1) previous and current state-of-the-art scientific research on designed 
                    DARPin molecules, (2) most successful DARPins that bound to their intended targets, and (3) most successful randomised 
                    IR modules that resulted in successful outcomes. With this strategy, we expected DARPins with excellent biophysical 
                    properties as well as high affinity and stability.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>
                    2. Synthesis of DARPins
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is aimed to affinity select DARPins binding AIP with the help of ribosome display. For this the DNA of the DARPin, 
                    which needs to be expressed, is needed. 32 of the potentially AIP targeting DARPins were synthesised via the BioXPTM 
                    by Codex DNA. In order to ensure that no random dimers or fragments are present in the synthesised DARPins they needed 
                    to be purified via gel extraction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As we wanted to prove that the selection method could be successful for our AIP binding DARPins, we firstly wanted 
                    to prove the method with a known protein-protein binding. We chose GFP binding DARPins as our test targeting protein, 
                    and naturally GFP as the target protein. For this, we aimed to produce our own GFP protein by expressing superfold-GFP 
                    in E. coli expression cells.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the experiments, we aimed to test both our own AIP binding DARPins, as well as our known GFP binding DARPin. 
                    To prove the quality of the binding affinity, we also placed our AIP binding DARPin in the same reaction with the 
                    GFP binding DARPin. This will prove that the most suitable DARPin will always bind to the specific target.

                    Our product QBlock would serve as a treatment for chronic wounds, particularly in their initial phases. 
                    Commonly, they manifest as a subsequent complication of longer-lasting health issues. Most chronic wounds have 
                    biofilms, which are mediated by quorum sensing. Our goal with the QBLOCK project is to reduce biofilm development 
                    by preventing bacterial autoinducing peptides (AIPs) from inducing other bacteria or the bacteria themselves through 
                    the use of DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins). We were needed to answer a few crucial questions in order to 
                    demonstrate our capacity to accomplish these actions necessary for the final product and its intended effect.

                    Measuring quorum sensing levels with a bioreporter
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To prove the impact that the DARPins have on the signalling molecules, we wanted a bioreporter that was able to 
                    produce the needed membrane proteins and internal signalling proteins, to bind the signalling molecules (AIP's) 
                    and then give an output to show that the cell has received the information of the binding. 
                    For this part of the project we took inspiration from a last year's iGEM team (Team IISER, Kolkata, 2021 iGEM team), 
                    who had built a bioreporter with the parts aimed to sense signalling molecules released from S. aureus bacteria. 
                    They had successful results, which made us confident that we can build a similar bioreporter but aimed for 
                    <em>S. epidermidis.</em>

                    Through the manipulation and randomization of amino acid locations, a DNA library of 42 DARPins was created. 
                    AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and their affinity for AIP was determined experimentally by 
                    ribosomal display. With our project, we showed that ribosome display can be an effective method for selecting the 
                    most suitable DARPin for the target signalling molecule, by testing the system with a known GFP-binding DARPin. 
                    We also built a bioreporter for detecting the effect our DARPins have on blocking the signalling between the bacteria. 
                    We tested the baseline signal of GFP from the bioreporter, however, due to time restrictions, we did not have time to 
                    test the bioreporter with DARPins included.

                    In order to ensure that our project is relevant and applicable in the real world, we have been talking to many 
                    experts from academia and the clinic as well as people with personal experiences. In addition to that we've been 
                    doing background research through literature to understand the extent of the problem and its impact on the world.

                    <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/aalto-helsinki/human-practices">In our wiki</a>, we have documented the steps we took 
                    during our project to evaluate the impact of our solution and how we've adjusted it based on the discussions 
                    we've had and the research we've done. <strong>Below, a summary of the human practices we did, that helped us shape and refine 
                    our solution:</strong>
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project ideation with our PIs.</li>
                    <li>Got ecouraged to look into alternatives to antibodies by Prof. Alexander Frey, thus DARPins becoming a core 
                        component of our project.</li>
                    <li>Based on the discussion with Dr. Christopher Jonkergrouw, we decided to focus on the signalling molecules AIPs 
                        instead of the receptor proteins to prevent fast-track evolution.</li>
                    <li>Got tips from Jouni Lounasmaa for project management.</li>
                    <li>Got feedback from wound healing researcher, Dr. Esko Kankuri for our solution's relevance, ideation and expected 
                        research methods.</li>
                    <li>Discussed with clinicians Heli Lagus and Milla Kallio what doctors and nurses face every day in the clinic. 
                        Also got valuable insight on the patients side.</li>
                    <li>Got help and furhter contacts for ribosome display from post doc Anja Paatero.</li>
                    <li>Received advice on different sequencing techniques and alternatives from Lab. engineer Lars Paulin.</li>
                    <li>Got help and support from our PI Ville Paavilainen and Doctoral researcher Kah Ying Ng for ribosome display.</li>
                    <li>Received coaching for presenting from The Science Basement staff.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our initial plan was to interview patients from the wound clinic, but unfortunately because of limitations we 
                    weren't able to contact any patients in the timeframe we had. Instead we decided to look for patient experiences 
                    from people we know and collected insight from our team members, that have or had a relative suffering from a 
                    chronic wound.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We have measured the impact of our project through thorough literacy research, the feedback of professionals and 
                    the stories from patients themselves. We have concluded that our project does have a positive impact on the world. 
                    Additionally, the discussions we've had have impacted and steered our project development through the whole process. 
                    <strong>We have listened to the feedback we have gotten and tried to change our project for the better.</strong>
